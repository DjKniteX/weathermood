## Project Notes
WeatherMood
Go to the site, shows the current weather and the plays music based on the weather

Nice little SPA, teaching myself angular

Call a weather service, get current weather -> pass that back to the front end

TODOS:
Figure out the wireframe
Build out the weather-service component
Add concise stylings
